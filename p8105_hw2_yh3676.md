## Problem 1

Clean `pols-month.csv` data

``` r
pols_month = 
  read_csv("./data/pols-month.csv") |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  separate(mon, into = c("year","month","day"), sep = "-") |>
  mutate(month = month.abb[as.numeric(month)],
         president =  ifelse(prez_gop == 1,"gop","dem")) |> 
  select(-prez_dem, -prez_gop, -day)
```

Clean `snp.csv` data

``` r
snp_df = 
  read_csv("./data/snp.csv") |>
  separate(date, into = c("month", "day", "year"), sep = "/") |>
  mutate(month = month.abb[as.numeric(month)]) |>
  mutate(year = ifelse(as.numeric(year) <= 16, paste0("20", year), paste0("19", year))) |>
  select(-day) |>
  select(year, month, everything())
```

Clean `unemployment.csv` data

``` r
unempl_df = 
  read_csv("./data/unemployment.csv") |>
  pivot_longer(Jan:Dec, names_to = "month", values_to = "unemployment rate") |> 
  rename(year = Year) |>
  mutate(year = as.character(year))
```

Merging `snp` into `pols`, and then merging `unemployment` into the
result.

``` r
# Merging `snp_df` into `pols_month`
merge_df_1 =
  left_join(pols_month, snp_df, by = c("year","month"))

# Then merging `unempl_df`:
merge_df = 
  left_join(merge_df_1, unempl_df, by = c("year","month"))
```

- The file`pol_month.csv` contains data on the number of democratic or
  republican national politicians at various points in time between 1947
  and 2015.
- The file `snp.csv` contains data related to Standard & Poor’s stock
  market index from 1950 to 2015.
- The file `unemployment.csv` contains monthly percentage of
  unemployment data from 1948 to 2015. \* The resulting dataset is
  merged by the above three datasets, which comprises 822 observations
  and 11 variables. It covers a 68-year range from 1947 to 2015. Key
  variables in the resulting dataset are
  `year`,`month`,`president`,`close` and `unemployment rate`.

## Problem 2

Clean the *Mr. Trash Wheel* sheet

``` r
mr_wheel = 
  read_excel('./data/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx', sheet = 1, range = 'A2:N586') |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year))
```

The data include a column for the (approximate) number of homes powered.
This calculation is described in the `Homes powered note`, but not
applied to every row in the dataset. Update the data to include a new
`homes_powered` variable based on this calculation.

``` r
mr_wheel = mutate(mr_wheel, homes_powered = weight_tons * 500 / 30)
```

Use a similar process to import, clean, and organize the data for
*Professor Trash Wheel* and *Gwynnda*, and combine these with the
*Mr. Trash Wheel* dataset to produce a single tidy dataset.

``` r
professor_wheel = 
  read_excel('./data/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx', sheet = 2, range = 'A2:M108') |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  mutate(homes_powered = weight_tons*500/30) |>
  mutate(type = 'professor trash wheel')

gwynnda_wheel = 
  read_excel('./data/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx', sheet = 4, range = 'A2:L157') |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  mutate(homes_powered = weight_tons*500/30) |>
  mutate(type = 'gwynnda trash wheel')

mr_wheel = mutate(mr_wheel, type = 'mr trash wheel')

## Combine the three datasets
Combine_wheel = 
  full_join(mr_wheel, professor_wheel) |> 
  full_join(gwynnda_wheel)
```

- The `Combine_wheel` is a collection of three datasets with 845 number
  of observations. 584 observations from the *Mr. Trash Wheel* dataset,
  106 observations from the *Professor Trash Wheel* dataset, and 155
  observations from the *Gwynnda Trash Wheel* dataset. For key
  variables, each observation contains the date (`month`, `year` and
  `date`), weight(`weight_tons`) and volume(`volume_cubic_yards`) of
  trash, number of different trash categories (e.g. `plastic_bags`,
  `cigarette_butts`), and which trash wheel it belongs to.
- The total weight of trash collected by Professor Trash Wheel is 216.26
  tons.
- The total number of cigarette butts collected by Gwynnda in July of
  2021 is 1.63^{4}.
